# Facial Recognition Application With SNN & Yolov8

the following repo hightlights how to train a siamese NN on a image similiarty using a public available dataset (LFW) and Intergrating it with Yolov8-face.

## Workflow

1. Implementing the SNN architecture with DeepLearning and preparing the similar/different pairs of images.

2. Training & evaluating the model

3. Integrating the SNN with yolo 

## 1. Architecture 
VGG19 was used as encoder for the lack of data and some layers were added for the network to understand how to distinguish similar from different pairs

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run the application

(Have fun trying it out)
